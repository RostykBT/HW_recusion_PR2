### Recursion 25

1. Create an algorithm and the corresponding program (in C ) to:
From the 1st keyboard, the real numbers X (X<1) and  (0<<1) are entered;
2. Using a recursive function, a real array A is formed
       elements
 A0  = 1,                 
 A1  = – X^3/3!
 A2  = X^5/5!
          . . .
up to the number of elements L of array A either satisfies the condition |A_L – A_L-1|<=   or (if this condition is not satisfied) L = 15;
3. The number  of the elements  of the array A and the elements are output to the file F with  their indexes.
